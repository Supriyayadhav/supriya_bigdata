Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

	Because they are not written in machine-readable language, Python programs need to be processed 
	before machines can run them. Python is an interpreted language. 
	This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it 
	into machine-readable byte code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
	Python is a dynamically typed language because it doesn’t know about the type of the variable until 
	the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location 
	and then binds that variable name to that memory container. 
	And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. 
	So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

==>The pros of Python
	Python is easy to learn and read
	Python enhances productivity
	Python has a vast collection of libraries
	Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
	Python is a portable programming language
	Python is an interpreted language
==>The cons of python programming language
	Python has speed limitations
	Python can have runtime errors
	Python consumes a lot of memory space

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

	Machine learning / Artificial intelligence
	Desktop GUI
	Data analytics and data visualization 
	Web development
	Game development
	Mobile app development
	Embedded systems
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

	Variable is a name given to Memory Location

declaring variables

	int_var=6
	str_var='Hello' or("Hello")
	float_var=12.5
	bool_var=True or (False)--this should be Initcap

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

	using input() function
	int_var=input() or (input('enter a value'))
	str_var=input()
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
	it ia always String
Q8. What is type casting?
	converting the data type of variables 
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Q10. What are keywords?
	keywords are inbuilt words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything 
	but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available. 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
	We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.
	They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. 
	All the keywords except True , False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
	Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
	Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
	the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
	using print() function
Q14. What are operators in Python?

	Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.
	different types of operators: arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
	/ - gives the float value
	//- gives the interger value

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
	# Declare a variable
	str_var='iNeuron'
	print('output value is : ',str_var*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

	#Checking if the number is odd or even
	int_var=int(input('Enter a Number to be checked : '))
	if int_var%2==0:
	    print('Number is Even',int_var)
	else :
	    print('Number is Odd',int_var)
Q18. What are boolean operator?
	the final result that will be checked using logical operators on AND or OR will give true or False which are boolean operators
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 ---1

0 and 0 --0

True and False and True --False

1 or 0 or 0 --1


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

	A conditional statement is used to handle conditions in your program.
	These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program. 

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

	IF : It decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not. It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the ” if ” block will be executed otherwise not.
	
	elif : if the condition in the IF is not satisfied it checks for another condition inside elif
	ELSE : if none of the conditions are satisfied it will go to else block and return thr output as mentioned
		this is not mandatory in if-else block .

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

	age_var = int(input('Enter the age of a person : '))
	if age_var>=18 :
	    print('I can vote ',age_var)
	else:
	    print("I can't vote ",age_var)

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.


a=int(input('Enter a number a : '))
b=int(input('Enter a number b : '))
c=int(input('Enter a number c : '))

if a>b and a>c :
    print('Greatest no is a ',a)
elif b>a and b>c :
    print('Greatest no is b ',b)    
elif c>a and c>b :
    print('Greatest no is c ',c)
